    "\n",
    "Python uses a private heap to manage memory, which is a data structure that keeps track of all the objects and data in a Python program. Unlike languages like C or C++, Python's memory management is automatic and handles tasks such as allocation and deallocation of memory dynamically. It employs a technique called garbage collection to automatically reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. Additionally, Python employs reference counting to keep track of the number of references to an object, and objects with zero references are automatically deallocated. This approach simplifies memory management for developers but may lead to overhead and occasional performance implications compared to manual memory management in languages like C or C++.\n",

Itâ€™s implemented by defining a new class that extends an existing class using the syntax class NewClass(BaseClass):. Subclasses inherit all attributes and methods from the base class and can override or extend them as needed. Inheritance differs from composition, where objects are composed of other objects rather than inheriting behavior. In composition, the relationship between classes is typically looser, and objects can be composed of multiple components, whereas inheritance implies an is-a relationship between classes."
